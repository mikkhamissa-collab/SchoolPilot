# SchoolPilot Pricing Strategy
*Generated: Feb 22, 2026*

## Market Context

### What Students/Parents Currently Pay

| Product | Price | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Shovel | $19.99/mo, $159.99/yr | Expensive outlier |
| MyStudyLife+ | $4.99/mo, $29.99/yr | Mainstream reference |
| MyStudyLife Family | $6.99-$14.99/mo | Parent premium |
| Quizlet Plus | $7.99/mo, $35.99/yr | Content-focused |
| Knowt | Free (ads) | Loss leader strategy |
| Notion | Free for students | Freemium |
| Spotify Student | $5.99/mo | Price anchor for subscriptions |
| Netflix | $6.99-$15.49/mo | Entertainment reference |

**Key insight:** Students are conditioned to $5-10/mo for digital subscriptions. Parents will pay 2-3x for "education."

## Pricing Principles

### 1. **Free Must Be Useful**
Students won't pay until they're hooked. Free tier needs to deliver real value (not just a trial).

### 2. **Price Anchors to "Worth It"**
Compare to: tutoring ($50-100/hr), test prep ($500+), bad grades (priceless stress). $10/mo is trivial.

### 3. **Parents Are the Real Buyers**
Students have no money. Parents have credit cards + anxiety about grades. Price for parents, market to students.

### 4. **Annual Discount Drives LTV**
Monthly looks cheap, but churn kills you. Aggressive annual discount (40-50% off) locks in retention.

---

## Recommended Pricing Tiers

### Tier 1: Free
**Goal:** Acquisition + habit formation

**Includes:**
- LMS sync (unlimited)
- Grade tracking (3 courses)
- Basic risk alerts ("You're below target")
- Daily priority view
- 1 AI study session/week

**Limitations:**
- 3 courses max
- No "what do I need" calculator
- No parent sharing
- Basic alerts only (no grade projections)
- Weekly AI limit

**Why this works:** Students get hooked on the sync + alerts. They upgrade when they want more courses or deeper analysis.

---

### Tier 2: SchoolPilot Pro — $6.99/mo or $49.99/yr
**Goal:** Convert engaged students

**Includes everything in Free, plus:**
- Unlimited courses
- Full "what do I need" calculator
- Grade projections ("If you score X, your grade becomes Y")
- Unlimited AI study sessions
- Practice test generation
- Smart notifications (timing optimization)
- Priority email support

**Why $6.99:**
- Below Quizlet ($7.99)
- Below Netflix
- Above "throwaway" pricing
- ~$50/yr annual feels like "one textbook"

---

### Tier 3: SchoolPilot Family — $12.99/mo or $99.99/yr
**Goal:** Capture parent willingness-to-pay

**Includes everything in Pro, plus:**
- Parent dashboard (view grades + risks)
- Parent notifications ("Your child's calc grade dropped to B")
- Weekly parent summary email
- Up to 3 students per family
- Grade trend reports
- Priority support

**Why $12.99:**
- MyStudyLife Family is $6.99-14.99/mo
- Parents pay more for visibility + peace of mind
- "Less than one tutoring session per month"

**Positioning:** "Know how your kid is doing without asking."

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Free Only (Month 1-2)
**Goal:** Validate product, gather feedback, build user base

- Launch with Free tier only
- No paywall
- Focus on getting 100+ active users at ASL
- Collect testimonials + usage data

### Phase 2: Introduce Pro (Month 3)
**Goal:** Test willingness to pay

- Keep Free tier
- Launch Pro at $6.99/mo, $49.99/yr
- Offer "Founding Member" discount: $39.99/yr (20% off annual)
- Lock in early adopters at discounted rate forever

### Phase 3: Introduce Family (Month 4-5)
**Goal:** Capture parent segment

- Launch Family tier
- Market to parents directly (Facebook ads, parent newsletters)
- Partner with school counselors for referrals

---

## Conversion Tactics

### 1. **Upgrade Triggers**
Show upgrade prompts at high-intent moments:
- "Add your 4th course? Upgrade to Pro"
- "Want to know exactly what score you need? Upgrade to Pro"
- "This assignment could drop your grade. See projections with Pro"

### 2. **Trial Psychology**
Instead of 7-day trial, use **feature unlocks**:
- "You've used 3 AI study sessions. Upgrade for unlimited"
- Creates scarcity without time pressure

### 3. **Annual Push**
- Default to annual pricing (show monthly as secondary)
- "2 months free with annual" framing
- Offer monthly-to-annual upgrade mid-subscription

### 4. **Student Discount Perception**
Even though everyone gets the same price, frame as:
- "Student pricing: $6.99/mo"
- Creates perception of discount

## Objection Handling

### "I can just check my grades myself"
"You can. But will you check every class, every day, and do the math on what you need? SchoolPilot does it automatically and alerts you before problems happen."

### "It's too expensive"
"It's less than one coffee per week. One better grade on one test is worth hundreds of hours of stress."

### "My school has a portal already"
"Your portal shows grades. SchoolPilot tells you what to DO about them. It's the difference between a dashboard and a copilot."

### "I'll just use the free version"
"Totally fine! Free gives you the alerts. Pro gives you the plan."

## Future Pricing Opportunities

### B2B: School Licenses
- $5-10/student/year for school-wide deployment
- Volume discounts at district level
- Potential: $50-200k per district

### Premium Add-ons
- 1:1 AI tutoring sessions: $X per session
- College application grade optimization: $49 one-time
- AP exam prep bundles: $29/exam

### Partnerships
- Test prep companies (Kaplan, Princeton Review)
- Tutoring platforms (Wyzant, Varsity Tutors)
- Revenue share on referrals

## Recommendation

**Launch with:**
1. Free tier (generous, habit-forming)
2. Pro at $6.99/mo or $49.99/yr
3. "Founding member" annual discount ($39.99) for first 100 users

**Wait on:**
- Family tier (add once you have parent demand signals)
- B2B (requires sales motion, not ready yet)

**Key metric to watch:**
- Free → Pro conversion rate
- Target: 5-10%
- If below 3%: pricing too high or free tier too generous
- If above 15%: leaving money on table, test higher price
