  # SchoolPilot Viral Playbook
*How to go from 0 → 10,000 users fast*

## The Core Truth

**Virality isn't a marketing tactic. It's a product feature.**

Apps that go viral have sharing built into how the product works — not bolted on as an afterthought. Dropbox didn't go viral because of ads. They went viral because sharing files required inviting others.

Your job: Find the **natural sharing moment** in SchoolPilot and make it frictionless.

## Part 1: The Growth Loop

Funnels are dead. Loops compound.

### SchoolPilot's Primary Growth Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   Student signs up                                      │
│         ↓                                               │
│   Gets daily plan / grade alert                         │
│         ↓                                               │
│   Screenshots it → shares to friends/groupchat          │
│         ↓                                               │
│   Friend sees it → "wait what app is that?"             │
│         ↓                                               │
│   Friend signs up                                       │
│         ↓                                               │
│   (Loop restarts)                                       │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The key insight:** Students already screenshot their grades and assignments to complain to friends. Make that screenshot a marketing asset.

---

## Part 2: Built-In Viral Mechanics

### 1. The "Study Buddy" Feature (Highest Impact)

**What:** Let students connect with classmates in the same courses.

**How it creates virality:**
- You can't study with a buddy unless they're on SchoolPilot
- "Invite [friend] to compare grades" is a natural CTA
- Creates FOMO: "Your classmates are using this"

**Implementation:**
```
When student adds a course:
→ "3 other ASL students are tracking [Calculus]. 
   Invite your classmates to compare progress."
→ [Share invite link]
```

**Why it works:** This is a **Personal Utility Network Effect** (from NFX research). The product becomes more valuable when your friends use it.

---

### 2. The Shareable Grade Card

**What:** A beautiful, branded image of your daily focus or grade status.

**How it works:**
- After completing tasks, show a "share your progress" card
- Card is designed to look good on Instagram Stories / Snapchat
- Includes subtle SchoolPilot branding + "Get your own plan" link

**Example card:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  🛡️ GRADE GUARDIAN             │
│                                │
│  Mik crushed 4 tasks today     │
│                                │
│  📊 Calc: 89% → on track       │
│  📊 English: 91% → safe        │
│  📊 Physics: 78% → watch       │
│                                │
│  schoolpilot.co                │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Trigger:** Show this after they mark their priority task done. Endorphin high = sharing moment.

---

### 3. The "What Do I Need?" Calculator Shareable

**What:** When students calculate "what do I need on the final to get an A," make it shareable.

**Why it's viral:** This is THE most common question students ask each other. "Bro what do you need on the final?" is texted millions of times during exam season.

**Implementation:**
```
After calculation:
"You need 87% on the final to keep your A-"

[Share this] → generates image:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  I need 87% on my Calc final   │
│  to keep my A-                 │
│                                │
│  What do YOU need?             │
│  → schoolpilot.co/calculator   │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Referral Program with Real Incentives

**Not this:** "Invite friends, get nothing"
**This:** "Invite 3 friends → unlock Pro free for a month"

**Tiered rewards:**
| Friends Invited | Reward |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Unlock dark mode customization |
| 3 | 1 month Pro free |
| 5 | 3 months Pro free |
| 10 | Pro free forever (Founding Member status) |

**The psychology:** Students have no money but lots of friends. Trade social capital for product access.

**Track with unique referral links:**
```
schoolpilot.co/r/mik123
```

## Part 3: Channel Strategy

### Tier 1: TikTok (Highest ROI for Student Apps)

**Why TikTok:** 
- 60% of users are under 24
- Algorithm favors new creators (you don't need followers)
- Knowt, Quizlet alternatives, and study apps blow up here constantly

**Content pillars:**

1. **"POV" Videos**
   - "POV: You finally know what to study"
   - "POV: The app tells you exactly what grade you need"
   - Screen recording of the app in action

2. **"Study with me" + Product Placement**
   - Film yourself studying
   - SchoolPilot dashboard visible on screen
   - Subtle, not salesy

3. **Relatable Student Struggles**
   - "When you have 47 assignments and don't know where to start"
   - Cut to: SchoolPilot showing one priority task
   - "Then this app just tells you what to do"

4. **Grade Reveal / Reaction**
   - "Checking if I can still get an A in calc..."
   - Use the grade calculator on camera
   - React to the result

**Posting cadence:** 2-3 videos/day for 30 days. Volume > quality initially.

**Hashtags:** #studytok #studywithme #studymotivation #studytips #collegelife #highschool #grindset #productivity

---

### Tier 2: Instagram Reels

**Same content as TikTok**, just cross-post. Different audience (slightly older, more curated).

Add: Instagram Stories with polls
- "Do you know exactly what you need on your final? 🤔"
- Swipe up → calculator

---

### Tier 3: Student Influencers (Micro-influencers)

**Target:** "Studygram" and "StudyTube" creators with 5k-50k followers.

**Why micro:** 
- Cheaper (often free product is enough)
- Higher engagement rates
- More trusted by peers

**Outreach template:**
```
Subject: Free tool for your followers?

Hey [name],

I built SchoolPilot — it syncs with your school's LMS and tells you 
exactly what to focus on each day (with grade impact).

Would love to give you + your followers free Pro access. 
No strings, just think your audience would genuinely find it useful.

Want me to send you a code?

— Mik
```

**Find them:** Search "study with me" on YouTube, "studygram" on Instagram, "studytok" on TikTok.

---

### Tier 4: Campus Ambassadors

**The play:** Recruit 1 student per school to spread SchoolPilot.

**What they do:**
- Share in class group chats
- Post on school-specific social media
- Word of mouth in their friend groups

**What they get:**
- Free Pro forever
- "Campus Ambassador" title (resume builder)
- Direct line to you (they feel important)
- Swag if you have budget

**How to recruit:**
- Start with ASL (your school — you ARE the ambassador)
- Ask early users: "Know anyone at [other school] who'd want this?"
- Post in student Discord servers

---

### Tier 5: Reddit & Online Communities

**Subreddits:**
- r/GetStudying (1.5M members)
- r/college
- r/highschool
- r/APStudents
- r/HomeworkHelp
- School-specific subreddits

**The rule:** Don't spam. Provide value first.

**Good post:**
```
Title: I built a free tool that tells you what grade you need on your final

Hey r/GetStudying — I'm a high school student and I built this because 
I was tired of spreadsheets.

You put in your current grade and it tells you exactly what you need 
on upcoming assignments to hit your target.

It's free: [link]

Would love feedback if you try it.
```

**Bad post:**
```
CHECK OUT MY APP SCHOOLPILOT!!!
```

---

### Tier 6: School Partnerships (Longer-term)

**The vision:** Get SchoolPilot officially recommended by schools.

**Start small:**
- Ask a teacher you like to mention it in class
- Get it in the school newsletter
- Present to student council

**Expand:**
- Pitch to school counselors (they want students to succeed)
- Offer "school license" — all students free, admin dashboard for counselors

**This is slow but defensible.** Once a school officially uses you, competitors can't get in.

---

## Part 4: The ASL Domination Strategy

Before going wide, **own your home turf.**

### Week 1-2: Seed Users
- Get 10 friends using it daily
- Watch them use it — what do they click? What confuses them?
- Fix friction points

### Week 3-4: Class Group Chats
- Share in every class group chat you're in
- Script: "yo I made this app that shows what you need on assignments to keep your grade — [link]"
- Ask friends to share in chats you're not in

### Week 5-6: Critical Mass
- Target: 50+ ASL students active
- Create FOMO: "Most of junior class is using this"
- The app should feel like "everyone has it"

### Week 7+: Expand to Other Schools
- Ask users: "What school do your friends go to?"
- Recruit one ambassador per school
- Repeat the playbook

## Part 5: Viral Hooks to Build Into the Product

### 1. Onboarding Share Gate
```
After signup:
"Want to skip the waitlist? Share with 2 friends."
[Share link] → instant access

(Creates urgency + immediate sharing)
```

### 2. Streak Sharing
```
"You've completed your focus task 7 days in a row! 🔥"
[Share your streak]
```

### 3. End-of-Week Recap
```
Every Sunday:
"This week you:
- Completed 12 tasks
- Protected your A in Calculus
- Improved Physics from 78% → 82%

Share your wins?"
```

### 4. Grade Milestone Celebrations
```
When grade crosses a threshold:
"🎉 You just hit 90% in English!"
[Share this win]
```

### 5. "Panic Mode" Shareable
```
When a student has 5+ overdue items:
Show dramatic UI → "PANIC MODE ACTIVATED"
This is meme-able. Students will screenshot and share.
```

## Part 7: Metrics to Track

### Viral Coefficient (K-factor)
```
K = (invites sent per user) × (conversion rate of invites)

Goal: K > 1 means exponential growth
```

**Track:**
- How many users share?
- How many clicks on shared links?
- How many of those convert?

### Activation Rate
```
% of signups who sync their LMS within 24 hours
Goal: >50%
```

### Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
```
Measures stickiness
Goal: >30% (means people use it ~weekly)
```

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
```
"How likely are you to recommend SchoolPilot to a friend?"
0-6: Detractors
7-8: Passives  
9-10: Promoters

Goal: NPS > 50
```

## Part 8: What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't buy followers or fake engagement**
- Algorithms detect this and punish you
- Real students can tell

❌ **Don't spam Discord servers**
- You'll get banned and damage reputation
- Be a member first, contributor second, promoter third

❌ **Don't run paid ads yet**
- You don't have product-market fit confirmed
- Paid acquisition is for scaling, not finding fit

❌ **Don't build features for virality before the product is good**
- A shared link to a bad product kills growth
- Nail the core experience first

❌ **Don't ignore negative feedback**
- Early critics are your best teachers
- Fix what they complain about

---

## Part 9: The 10,000 User Target

### Math:
- ASL has ~1,500 students
- If 30% adopt = 450 users
- Each user invites 2 friends at other schools = 900 more
- Those users invite 2 each = 1,800 more
- **3 viral cycles = 3,150 users from ASL alone**

To hit 10,000:
- Replicate ASL playbook at 5-10 schools
- Or: 1 TikTok video hits 500k views (1-2% conversion = 5,000-10,000)

### Timeline:
| Month | Target Users | How |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| 1 | 100 | ASL friends + group chats |
| 2 | 500 | ASL saturation + 2 other schools |
| 3 | 2,000 | TikTok starts hitting + referrals |
| 4 | 5,000 | Viral loop compounding |
| 5 | 10,000 | Multiple schools + organic TikTok growth |

---

## The Bottom Line

Virality = **Natural sharing moments** + **Low friction** + **Social proof**

Your product already has natural sharing moments (grades, study plans). Your job is to:
1. Make sharing effortless (one tap)
2. Make the shared content look good (branded, clean)
3. Make the receiver want to sign up (clear value prop)

The best marketing is a product people want to talk about. Make SchoolPilot that product.
